        "\n",
        "**1. How are trees constructed?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- You start with the entire dataset, and you aim to split it into smaller groups based on the target variable (for example, whether someone got divorced or not).\n",
        "\n",
        "- First, you find the best feature to split the data by. For example, a certain question may be a very strong predictor for divorce, and you could first split the data by that. You do this, by looking at which feature reduces impurity the most (i.e. which group has the has lowest Gini impurity score).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Then, you repeat this process for each subgroup until you either reach a point where you have impurity of 0 or can no longer find meaningful splits.\n",
        "\n",
        "- For regression tasks, instead of Gini impurity scores, you use lowest SSE.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. How do trees handle non-linear relationships between variables? Compare this to linear models.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Trees handle non-linear relationships between variables really well by splitting on variables in the way described in my response to question 1. A good example is with the divorce data. There were 54 questions with response values from 0-4 where 0 meant strongly agree and 4 meant never, and the outcome variable of interest is divorce/married. The relationship between the variables and whether they are divorced or not is not really best measured by a straight line. Rather, the outcome likely depends on a combination of the answers. So, in a linear model, you could do interaction terms between questions in the divorce survey, for example, but that would get really messy, and would likely overfit with too many variables. So, trees handle these non-linear relationships between variables by splitting on them.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Why is the Gini a good loss function for categorical target variables?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Gini impurity score is a measure of how \"mixed\" the subgroups are after you split the data. With decision trees, you are trying to split the data set into smaller groups based on the target variable to make the best predictions. For predicting a categorical target variable, when you split the dataset into groups, you want one feature to split the data in such a way that the subgroups are dominated by one of the categories in the categorical target variable(s). So, the Gini impurity score is a measure of how \"mixed\" the subgroups are. You want a low Gini impurity score.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Why do trees tend to overfit, and how can this tendency be constrained?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Trees are prone to overfitting because they can essentially just memorize the original dataset and produce not meaningful splits/\"grow out of control.\" They may find splits in the data that work really well for the specific sample, but don't hold true for other datasets, and may be overfitting to quirks or specificities in the first dataset. They essentially can \"grow out of control\" and memorize the training data, which does not usually work well for unforeseen data because it splits in unmeaningful ways towards the end, for example. You can contrain this tendency by imposing stopping rules.\n",
        "- One stop rule you can use is *max-depth*, which says stop after a certain number of leaves. This is simple, but can be too rigid.\n",
        "- Another is *min_impurity_decrease*, which says only split it if it reduces impurity by enough. This is more flexible and data-driven.\n",
        "- A third is *min_samples_leaf*, which says do not allow terminal nodes with too few of observations. That is helpful to prevent weird splits on outliers.\n",
        "In summary, trees are prone to overfitting because they can essentially just memorize the original dataset and produce not meaningful splits/\"grow out of control.\"\n",
        "Also worth noting that early stopping is a form of regularization, which is an important ML concept that refers to imposing constraints on the model to force it not to overfit.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. True or false, and explain: Trees only really perform well in situations with lots of categorical variables as features/covariates.**\n",
        "\n",
        "False. Trees can perform really well for numeric continuous variables too and for tasks like regression. With numeric variables, tree models look for values that best divide the data. For example, if you want to predict type of landmine using voltage, you can look at the density plot from class and see that above a .75 voltage, land mine types are almost entirely either mine type 1 or 2, and below that are either 3-5. So, you can split by .75 where types 4 and 5 drop off to 0. That is how splits work with numeric predictors.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Why don't most versions of classification/regression tree concept allow for more than two branches after a split?**\n",
        "\n",
        "While you can extend ideas of Gini impurity to go beyond two branches after a split, most people avoid that because it gets messy fast. Binary splits keep the model simple and interpretable and since trees are already sensitive to original data and can easily overfit, that is generally why we prefer to keep it simple with binary trees to avoid increased complexity, computation overhead and overfitting risks.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**7. What are some heuristic ways you can examine a tree and decide whether it is probably over- or under-fitting?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Good thing to do is visualize the tree, and then you can check for everything below.\n",
        "\n",
        "One way is checking the tree depth (how many levels there are to the tree) because if there are too many levels, the tree may be too deep, and may be overfitting by capturing too much noise and small details from the training set. Conversely, if it is too shallow (too little levels), it could be underfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another way is to look at how many nodes/splits there are. Too many ==> overfitting. Too little ==> underfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another way is just examining the accuracy on the training and test set. If the training set accuracy is really high and the test set is really low ==> you are probably overfitting. If really bad on both ==> probably underfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "If overfitting, you can do response in question 4 regularization techniques."
